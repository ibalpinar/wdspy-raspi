# wdspy-raspi
This is the Water Dispenser Spy that track and record your all dispensers data on the cloud. You will be able to access all your data from your mobile device. This project aims to be experimental, both for personal development and to make the home smarter. Finally, the project is completely open source and you can use it whatever you want.

This script will run on the Raspberry Pi and collect all the data from the water flow sensor and write it as a json array to a file on the disc.
